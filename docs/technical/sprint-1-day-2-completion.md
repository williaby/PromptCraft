- **Resolution**: Configure QDRANT_API_KEY in production environment
- **Workaround**: System gracefully falls back to mock operations for development

### Minor Performance Notes
- **OpenRouter API**: 401 authentication errors cause fallback to mock document generation
- **Impact**: No hypothetical documents generated, but system remains functional
- **Resolution**: Configure OpenRouter API key for enhanced document generation
- **Current**: System operates in "query analysis only" mode
