# Domain Research Charter & Framework

**Date**: 2025-09-04
**Sprint**: Sprint 0 - Track 4
**Duration**: 2 days charter + ongoing research
**Purpose**: Establish systematic domain research for conceptual confusion expansion

## 🎯 Executive Mandate

Based on Executive Team Layered Consensus, the domain research track will systematically expand HyDE's conceptual confusion detection beyond the current PowerPoint/Visio/Excel patterns to cover the **top 3 priority domains**:

### Target Domains (Executive Decision)
1. **Microsoft Excel**: Spreadsheet vs database confusion
2. **Salesforce**: CRM vs general database confusion
3. **Slack**: Communication vs file management confusion

### Strategic Rationale
- **Market Differentiation**: "System smart enough to know what it can't do"
- **User Trust Building**: Educational approach rather than just content generation
- **Data-Driven Expansion**: Use real user pain points to guide development

## 📋 Research Framework

### Research Deliverable Template (Per Software)

Each domain research must produce a comprehensive specification following this exact template:

#### Software Overview
- **Primary Purpose**: Core function the software was designed for
- **Key Capabilities**: Top 5 features users commonly leverage
- **Common Use Cases**: Typical business scenarios where software excels

   - **Reality**: [What the software actually does]
   - **User Impact**: [Why this confusion causes problems]
   - **Detection Keywords**: [Phrases that indicate this confusion]

#### Detection Patterns
- **Primary Keywords**: Main terms that suggest impossible operations
- **Context Patterns**: Sentence structures that indicate confusion
- **False Positive Avoidance**: Legitimate use cases that sound similar
- **Confidence Scoring**: How certain we can be about mismatch detection

#### Educational Responses

## 🎯 Priority Domain 1: Microsoft Excel

### Research Charter
**Timeline**: Week 1 of Sprint 1
**Resources**: Domain Expert (3 hours) + Engineering Consultation (30 minutes)
**Deliverable**: Complete Excel confusion detection specification

### Known Patterns (Starting Point)
Based on current system knowledge, Excel confusion often involves:

#### Database Operation Confusion
- **Misconception**: "Excel can replace a proper database"
- **Reality**: Excel is a spreadsheet tool, not a relational database
- **Detection Keywords**: "Excel database", "SQL in Excel", "Excel joins"
- **Alternative**: Microsoft Access, SQL Server, or cloud databases

#### Web Application Confusion
- **Misconception**: "Excel can host web applications"
- **Reality**: Excel creates files, not web apps
- **Detection Keywords**: "Excel website", "Excel web app", "Excel hosting"
- **Alternative**: Power Apps, SharePoint, or web development platforms

#### Advanced Programming Confusion
- **Misconception**: "Excel can do complex software development"
- **Reality**: Excel has VBA but isn't a general programming platform
- **Detection Keywords**: "Excel API development", "Excel microservices"
- **Alternative**: Proper programming languages and frameworks

### Research Questions for Domain Expert
1. What are the most common Excel misconceptions you've encountered in business settings?
2. What impossible tasks do users frequently ask Excel to perform?
3. How can we detect when someone is trying to use Excel beyond its intended scope?
4. What are the best alternative tools to suggest for each misconception?

- **Reality**: Salesforce is a CRM optimized for sales/marketing processes
- **Detection Keywords**: "Salesforce inventory management", "Salesforce accounting"

#### Technical Platform Confusion

### Research Focus Areas
1. **CRM Boundaries**: What tasks are beyond Salesforce's CRM focus?
2. **Technical Limitations**: What development requests are inappropriate?

- **Reality**: Slack is for communication, not file storage/organization
- **Detection Keywords**: "Slack file server", "Slack document library"

#### Database/CRM Confusion
- **Misconception**: "Slack can store and query business data"
- **Reality**: Slack stores messages, not structured business data
- **Detection Keywords**: "Slack customer database", "Slack inventory tracking"

#### Project Management Confusion
- **Misconception**: "Slack can replace dedicated project management tools"
- **Reality**: Slack facilitates communication about projects, not project management
- **Detection Keywords**: "Slack Gantt charts", "Slack project timelines"

### Research Questions
1. What business functions do users incorrectly think Slack can handle?
2. How can we distinguish between legitimate Slack automation vs. scope confusion?
3. What are the clearest indicators that someone is treating Slack like a different tool?
