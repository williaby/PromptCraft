# Scope Analysis: Phase 1 Issue 2

## Environment Prerequisites
- ‚úÖ **Environment Status**: Cannot validate (Poetry configuration error)
- üìã **Prerequisites Check**: Issue #1 (Development Environment Setup) must be completed
- üîß **Environment Ready**: No - Poetry configuration needs fixing first

## Issue Overview
- **Title**: Core Configuration System
- **Description**: Implement centralized configuration system with environment-specific settings, encrypted secrets management, and validation
- **Estimated Time**: 5 hours

## Dependency Analysis
‚úÖ **Current Issue Provides**:
- Centralized configuration management with Pydantic
- Environment-specific settings (dev, staging, prod)
- Encrypted secrets management via .env files
- Configuration validation and error handling
- Health check endpoints with configuration status
- Foundation for all other components to access settings

üîó **Dependent Issues**:
- Issue #3 (Docker Development Environment) - needs configuration system for environment settings
- Issue #4 (C.R.E.A.T.E. Framework Engine) - needs configuration for API settings and Zen MCP integration
- Issue #9 (Security Implementation) - needs encryption.py integration for secrets management
- Issue #36 (Code Reuse Architecture Setup) - needs configuration patterns for shared components

üìã **Prerequisites**:
- Issue #1 (Development Environment Setup) - must have GPG/SSH keys and basic environment ready
- `.env` file created based on provided example

‚ùå **EXCLUDED** (Handled by Other Issues):
- Docker configuration files (handled by Issue #3)
- Zen MCP Server configuration (handled by Issue #4)
- Production deployment configurations (handled by Issue #10)
- Security middleware and headers (handled by Issue #9)
- Monitoring and observability configuration (handled by Issue #34)

## Scope Boundaries
‚úÖ **INCLUDED in Issue**:
- Configuration classes defined with Pydantic schema
- Environment-specific configs working (dev, staging, prod)
- .env file encryption/decryption integrated with settings loading
- All configuration parameters validated with appropriate error messages
- Default configurations allow immediate development start
- Health check endpoints return configuration status
- Sensitive values never logged or exposed in error messages

‚ùå **EXCLUDED from Issue**:
- Actual deployment configurations (just the system to manage them)
- Zen MCP Server specific configurations
- Docker compose configurations
- CI/CD pipeline configurations
- Production infrastructure settings
- Monitoring/alerting configurations
- Rate limiting configurations
- CORS and security headers configuration

üîó **BOUNDARY CLARIFICATION**:
- This issue creates the configuration SYSTEM, not the actual configurations
- Other issues will use this system to manage their specific settings
- Focus on the framework and patterns, not specific service configurations
- Encryption is for .env files only, not for other data encryption needs

‚ùì **UNCLEAR Requirements**:
- Specific configuration schema/parameters needed (to be defined during implementation)
- Integration pattern with existing `src/utils/encryption.py`
- Whether configuration hot-reload is required
- Specific health check response format

## Automated Validation
‚úÖ **Scope Validation Checks**:
- ‚úÖ Cross-check: All acceptance criteria focus on configuration system, not specific configs
- ‚úÖ Pass/fail criteria: Each criterion has clear testable outcome
- ‚úÖ Issue overlap: Clear separation from Docker (Issue #3) and Security (Issue #9) configs
- ‚úÖ Time estimate: 5 hours reasonable for Pydantic-based configuration system

## Next Steps
- Fix Poetry configuration issue before proceeding
- Proceed to `/project:workflow-plan-validation` with these boundaries
- Clarify configuration schema requirements with user if needed
- Ensure `src/utils/encryption.py` is understood before implementing
