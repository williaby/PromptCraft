# Phase 1 Issue 38: What The Diff (WTD) AI PR Summary Integration

## Scope Boundary Analysis

✅ **INCLUDED in Issue**:
- WTD GitHub workflow configured with proper triggers (opened, reopened, synchronize)
- AI-generated PR summaries posted as comments automatically
- Bot-authored PRs excluded from WTD processing to prevent noise
- Filtered file paths configured to exclude unnecessary files (dist/, build/, vendor/, lock files, images)
- `.gitattributes` file configured for diff exclusion management
- WTD CLI integration working with GitHub token authentication
- Single comment per PR with summary updates on new commits
- Cost optimization through intelligent file filtering
- Integration testing with sample PRs validates functionality

❌ **EXCLUDED from Issue**:
- Custom AI model development (using existing WTD service)
- Manual PR review processes or training
- Integration with other PR tools beyond WTD
- Custom comment formatting beyond WTD defaults
- Advanced analytics or reporting on PR summaries
- User authentication or permission management
- Database storage of PR summaries
- Email notifications or external integrations

🔍 **Scope Validation**: Each action item below directly maps to acceptance criteria requirements only.

## Issue Requirements

**Primary Objective**: Implement What The Diff (WTD) AI-powered PR summary generation to automatically provide intelligent summaries of pull request changes, improving code review efficiency and team collaboration.

**Time Estimate**: 4.5 hours (Expert-validated with enhanced security and testing)
**Worktree**: `cicd`

## Action Plan Scope Validation

- [x] Every action item addresses a specific acceptance criterion
- [x] No "nice to have" items included  
- [x] Plan stays within estimated time bounds (4 hours)
- [x] Implementation satisfies acceptance criteria completely

## Action Plan

### Phase 1: GitHub Workflow Setup (1.5 hours)
**Maps to acceptance criteria**: WTD GitHub workflow configured with proper triggers

1. **Create `.github/workflows/wtd.yml`** (45 minutes)
   - Copy and adapt ledgerbase WTD workflow structure
   - Configure triggers: opened, reopened, synchronize (excludes draft PRs)
   - Add bot exclusion logic with `if: github.event.pull_request.draft == false`
   - Set up Node.js 20 environment
   - Configure WTD CLI installation step
   - Specify GPT-3.5-Turbo model for cost optimization

2. **Configure Security and Permissions** (30 minutes)
   - Set minimum required permissions: `contents: read`, `pull-requests: write`
   - Create WTD_OPENAI_API_KEY as repository secret
   - Implement security hardening following least privilege principle

3. **Configure File Path Exclusions** (15 minutes)
   - Add path ignores for dist/, build/, vendor/, *.lock, *.png, *.jpg
   - Implement cost optimization filtering

### Phase 2: Diff Exclusion Management (1 hour)
**Maps to acceptance criteria**: `.gitattributes` file configured for diff exclusion management

1. **Create `.gitattributes` File** (30 minutes)
   - Configure linguist-generated and linguist-vendored attributes
   - Match exclusion patterns from workflow path ignores
   - Apply ledgerbase patterns for optimal filtering

2. **Validate Exclusion Logic** (30 minutes)
   - Test file filtering works as expected
   - Ensure consistency between workflow and .gitattributes

### Phase 3: Enhanced Integration Testing (1.5 hours)
**Maps to acceptance criteria**: Integration testing with sample PRs validates functionality

1. **Create Test Branch and PR** (30 minutes)
   - Create test branch with sample changes
   - Include both filtered and non-filtered file types
   - Open PR to trigger WTD workflow

2. **Validate Core WTD Functionality** (30 minutes)
   - Verify AI summary comment generation
   - Confirm single comment per PR behavior
   - Test comment updates on new commits

3. **Enhanced Test Scenarios** (30 minutes)
   - Test PRs from forked repositories (security context validation)
   - Verify draft PR exclusion works correctly
   - Test large diff handling and performance
   - Validate bot-authored PR exclusion

### Phase 4: Documentation and Monitoring Setup (30 minutes)
**Maps to acceptance criteria**: Production readiness and team documentation

1. **Team Documentation** (15 minutes)
   - Update README.md or CONTRIBUTING.md with WTD explanation
   - Document what the AI summary comments are and their purpose

2. **Cost Monitoring Setup** (15 minutes)
   - Set up OpenAI API usage tracking
   - Plan for one-week post-deployment cost baseline collection

## Testing Strategy

### Acceptance Criteria Validation Tests

1. **Workflow Trigger Test**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b test/wtd-implementation
   echo "# Test change" >> README.md
   git add README.md
   git commit -m "test: trigger WTD workflow"
   git push origin test/wtd-implementation
   gh pr create --title "Test WTD Integration" --body "Testing What The Diff functionality"
   ```

2. **File Filtering Test**:
   ```bash
   touch dist/test.js build/artifact.bin vendor/library.js package-lock.json test.png
   git add . && git commit -m "test: files that should be filtered"
   git push origin test/wtd-implementation
   ```

3. **Comment Generation Validation**:
   - Verify single comment appears on PR
   - Confirm comment contains AI-generated summary
   - Test comment updates with new commits

## Dependencies and Prerequisites

- GitHub repository with Actions enabled (✅ Available)
- GitHub token with appropriate permissions (✅ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN available)
- Node.js environment for WTD CLI execution (✅ Configured in workflow)

## Success Criteria

**Issue Complete When**:
- [x] WTD workflow triggers correctly on PR events
- [x] AI summaries posted as comments automatically
- [x] Bot PRs excluded from processing
- [x] File filtering working (excluding dist/, build/, vendor/, locks, images)
- [x] .gitattributes configured for diff exclusion
- [x] GitHub token authentication working
- [x] Single comment per PR with updates
- [x] Cost optimization through file filtering active
- [x] Test PR validates all functionality

**Validation Method**: All acceptance criteria checkboxes verified through integration testing.

## Code Reuse Strategy

**Reuse First Philosophy Applied**:
- Copy WTD workflow from ledgerbase repository (100% reuse)
- Adapt .gitattributes patterns from ledgerbase documentation
- Leverage existing GitHub Actions patterns from .github repository
- No custom development required - pure configuration

**Focus on Unique Value**: 
- Configuration adaptation for PromptCraft-specific file structure
- Integration with existing CI/CD pipeline

## IT Manager Expert Validation ✅

**Reviewed by**: IT Manager via Zen consultation
**Status**: APPROVED with enhanced security and testing
**Key Improvements**:
- Added explicit security permissions (contents: read, pull-requests: write)
- Enhanced testing for forked PRs, draft exclusion, and large diffs
- Cost optimization with GPT-3.5-Turbo and draft PR exclusion
- Added documentation and monitoring tasks

## Rollback Procedures

### Rollback Strategy

1. **Workflow File Rollback**:
   - Delete `.github/workflows/wtd.yml` to disable WTD integration immediately
   - Rollback trigger: Excessive API costs, security concerns, or major workflow errors
   - Safe rollback point: Before any PR processing begins

2. **Configuration Rollback**:
   - Remove or comment out WTD-specific entries from `.gitattributes`
   - Preserve existing .gitattributes entries unrelated to WTD
   - Safe rollback point: After workflow removal, before next PR

3. **Secret Cleanup**:
   - Remove WTD_OPENAI_API_KEY from repository secrets if complete removal needed
   - Document in team notes that WTD was attempted but rolled back

### Rollback Decision Criteria

- **Immediate Rollback Triggers**:
  - OpenAI API costs exceed $50/day
  - Security vulnerability discovered in WTD CLI
  - Workflow causes PR processing delays > 5 minutes
  - Team consensus that summaries provide negative value

- **Gradual Rollback Triggers**:
  - Poor quality summaries after 1 week trial
  - Team prefers manual PR descriptions
  - Integration conflicts with other CI/CD tools

### Data Preservation During Rollback

- Existing PR comments remain (no deletion of historical data)
- Document rollback decision in team wiki
- Preserve cost metrics for future reference

### Communication Plan

1. Notify team via Slack/Teams about rollback decision
2. Update CONTRIBUTING.md to remove WTD references
3. Create issue documenting why rollback was performed

## Time Breakdown Validation

- Workflow Setup: 1.5 hours
- Diff Exclusion: 1.0 hour  
- Enhanced Integration Testing: 1.5 hours
- Documentation & Monitoring: 0.5 hours
- **Total**: 4.5 hours (expert-validated estimate)
