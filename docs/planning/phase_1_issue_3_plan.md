# Phase 1 Issue 3: Docker Development Environment

## Scope Boundary Analysis

✅ **INCLUDED in Issue**:

- Multi-stage Dockerfile builds successfully
- All services start and pass health checks (Gradio, FastAPI, Redis)
- External Qdrant connection verified (192.168.1.16:6333)
- Service-to-service communication working
- Volume mounts configured for hot reload during development
- Non-root user execution working (promptcraft:1000)
- Makefile commands operational for all common operations
- Container logs accessible and properly formatted
- Resource limits configured and respected

❌ **EXCLUDED from Issue**:
- Zen MCP Server Docker image (marked as TODO for project owner)
- Production deployment configuration (separate from development environment)
- Kubernetes or Docker Swarm orchestration
- Performance optimization beyond basic resource limits
- Monitoring/observability infrastructure (covered in Issue #34)
- Security hardening (covered in Issue #9)
- CI/CD pipeline integration
- Auto-scaling capabilities

🔍 **Scope Validation**: Every action item maps directly to acceptance criteria requirements

## Issue Requirements

**Primary Objective**: Create a complete Docker development environment with all services, proper networking, and health checks for local development connecting to external Qdrant vector database.

**Key Constraints**:
- External Qdrant server at 192.168.1.16:6333 (not containerized)
- Development environment focus (not production)
- 7-hour estimated completion time
- Non-root execution (promptcraft:1000)

## Action Plan Scope Validation

- [x] Every action item addresses a specific acceptance criterion
- [x] No "nice to have" items included  
- [x] Plan stays within estimated time bounds (7 hours)
- [x] Implementation satisfies acceptance criteria completely
- [x] IT manager consultation confirmed scope adherence

## Action Plan

### Phase 1: Create Docker Compose Configuration (2 hours)

**Scope Justification**: Required for "All services start and pass health checks" and "Service-to-service communication working"

1. **Create docker-compose.zen-vm.yaml file**
   - Define services: Gradio UI, FastAPI backend, Redis
   - Configure internal Docker networking
   - Set up service discovery via container names

2. **Configure service definitions**
   - Gradio UI service (port 7860)
   - FastAPI backend service (port 8000) 
   - Redis service (port 6379)
   - All services using existing Dockerfile

### Phase 2: Health Checks and External Connections (1.5 hours)

**Scope Justification**: Required for "All services start and pass health checks" and "External Qdrant connection verified"

3. **Implement health checks for all services**
   - HTTP health endpoints for Gradio and FastAPI
   - Redis ping health check
   - 30-second intervals, 10-second timeout, 3 retries

4. **Configure external Qdrant connection**
   - Verify connectivity to 192.168.1.16:6333
   - Add extra_hosts if needed for DNS resolution
   - Test connection from containers

### Phase 3: Development Features (2 hours)

**Scope Justification**: Required for "Volume mounts configured for hot reload" and "Non-root user execution working"

5. **Set up volume mounts for hot reload**
   - Mount source code directories for live development
   - Configure proper file permissions for promptcraft:1000
   - Ensure container can write to mounted volumes

6. **Verify non-root user execution**
   - Confirm all containers run as promptcraft:1000
   - Test file access permissions
   - Validate security constraints

### Phase 4: Resource Management and Logging (1 hour)

**Scope Justification**: Required for "Resource limits configured and respected" and "Container logs accessible and properly formatted"

7. **Configure resource limits**
   - Set appropriate CPU and memory limits for each service
   - Configure swap limits where appropriate
   - Test resource constraint enforcement

8. **Configure container logging**
   - Ensure structured log output (JSON format preferred)
   - Configure appropriate log drivers
   - Verify log accessibility via docker logs

### Phase 5: Integration and Testing (0.5 hours)

**Scope Justification**: Required for "Makefile commands operational for all common operations"

9. **Update and test Makefile commands**
   - Verify `make dev` command works with new compose file
   - Test service startup and shutdown
   - Validate all common operations

## Testing Strategy

### Acceptance Criteria Validation Tests

```bash
# Test 1: Multi-stage Dockerfile builds successfully
docker build -t promptcraft-test .

# Test 2: All services start and pass health checks
make dev
docker-compose -f docker-compose.zen-vm.yaml ps
curl http://localhost:7860/health  # Gradio
curl http://localhost:8000/health  # FastAPI
redis-cli -h localhost ping        # Redis

# Test 3: External Qdrant connection verified
docker exec -it promptcraft-app curl http://192.168.1.16:6333/health

# Test 4: Service-to-service communication working
docker exec -it promptcraft-app curl http://promptcraft-redis:6379/ping

# Test 5: Volume mounts configured for hot reload
# Modify source file and verify change reflected in container

# Test 6: Non-root user execution working
docker exec -it promptcraft-app whoami  # Should return 'promptcraft'

# Test 7: Makefile commands operational
make dev && make clean

# Test 8: Container logs accessible and properly formatted
docker logs promptcraft-app 2>&1 | head -10

# Test 9: Resource limits configured and respected
docker stats --no-stream
```

## Dependencies and Prerequisites

**Required Completed**:
- Issue #2: Core Configuration System
- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- External Qdrant server accessible at 192.168.1.16:6333

**Technical Prerequisites**:
- Existing multi-stage Dockerfile (present)
- Makefile with dev command (present, needs compose file)
- Source code structure established

## Success Criteria

**Primary Success Indicators**:
- All 9 acceptance criteria tests pass
- Development environment starts in under 2 minutes
- All services healthy and communicating
- Hot reload working for code changes
- External Qdrant connection functional

**Quality Gates**:
- Container logs are structured and readable
- Resource usage within expected bounds
- No security warnings from non-root execution
- Makefile commands work without modification

**Deliverables**:
- Working docker-compose.zen-vm.yaml file
- Updated service configurations with health checks
- Validated external Qdrant connectivity
- Functional hot reload development workflow

## Risk Mitigation

**Identified Risks**:
1. **External Qdrant connectivity**: Network configuration may require host networking or extra_hosts
2. **File permissions**: Volume mounts with non-root user may have permission issues
3. **Resource constraints**: Development environment may need resource limit tuning

**Mitigation Strategies**:
1. Test multiple networking approaches (bridge, host, extra_hosts)
2. Use proper chown/chmod in volume mount configuration
3. Start with conservative resource limits and adjust based on testing

## Time Allocation

- **Setup and Planning**: 0.5 hours
- **Docker Compose Creation**: 2 hours  
- **Health Checks and External Connections**: 1.5 hours
- **Development Features**: 2 hours
- **Resource Management**: 1 hour
- **Testing and Validation**: 0.5 hours
- **Buffer**: 0.5 hours

**Total**: 7 hours (matches issue estimate)
