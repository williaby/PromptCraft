# Phase 1 Issue 9: Application Security Hardening

## Scope Boundary Analysis

‚úÖ **INCLUDED in Issue**:
- .env file encryption/decryption with GPG following existing pattern
- Input sanitization preventing XSS, injection attacks for all user inputs
- CORS configuration for production with specific allowed origins
- Security headers middleware (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options)
- Rate limiting: 60 requests/minute per IP for API endpoints
- Dependency vulnerability scanning integrated in CI/CD
- Security testing suite with OWASP ZAP integration
- Audit logging for all security-relevant events
- **ADDED**: Secure error handling preventing stack trace leakage

‚ùå **EXCLUDED from Issue**:
- User authentication/authorization system (not mentioned in acceptance criteria)
- OAuth integration or external identity providers
- Database security configurations (no database mentioned in scope)
- Network security beyond CORS and headers
- Backup encryption or data-at-rest encryption beyond .env files
- SSL/TLS certificate management (infrastructure concern)
- Security documentation beyond implementation
- Penetration testing or external security audits

üîç **Scope Validation**: Every action item below directly addresses a specific acceptance criterion. No "nice to have" items included.

## Issue Requirements

**Original Estimate**: 8 hours  
**Revised Estimate**: 8-12 hours (IT manager validated)  
**Dependencies**: Issue #2 completed (Core Configuration System with encryption.py)

## Security Risk Register

| Risk | Impact | Proposed Mitigation |
|------|---------|-------------------|
| **No Authentication/Authorization** | HIGH - Application completely open to anyone | Address in Phase 2: User Authentication |
| **No SSL/TLS Enforcement** | HIGH - Data in transit unprotected | Address in Phase 2: Infrastructure Security |
| **Limited Database Security** | MEDIUM - Data at rest partially protected | Address in Phase 2: Database Security Review |
| **No User Context in Audit Logs** | MEDIUM - Limited forensic capability | Address in Phase 2: User Authentication Integration |

## Action Plan Scope Validation

- [x] Every action item addresses a specific acceptance criterion
- [x] No "nice to have" items included  
- [x] Plan stays within estimated time bounds (8-12 hours)
- [x] Implementation satisfies acceptance criteria completely
- [x] IT manager consultation completed and approved

## Action Plan

### Implementation Tiers (Optimized for Workflow Efficiency)

#### Tier 1: Application Middleware (Hours 1-3) - Quickest Wins
**Rationale**: Middleware provides immediate, application-wide security benefits

1. **Secure Error Handling** (30 minutes)
   - Configure FastAPI exception handlers to prevent stack trace leakage
   - Return generic 500 errors in production
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: Critical addition from IT manager review

2. **Security Headers Middleware** (1 hour)
   - Implement CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options
   - Configure FastAPI middleware for automatic header injection
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: Security headers middleware requirement

3. **CORS Configuration** (30 minutes)
   - Configure production-specific allowed origins
   - Implement FastAPI CORS middleware
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: CORS configuration for production

4. **Code Reuse Validation** (30 minutes)
   - **SPIKE**: Validate portability of security patterns from ledgerbase/FISProject
   - Confirm FastAPI compatibility with existing middleware
   - **Critical for timeline feasibility**

#### Tier 2: Endpoint-Level Logic (Hours 4-6)

5. **Rate Limiting Implementation** (1.5 hours)
   - Install and configure `slowapi` library (FastAPI-compatible rate limiting)
   - Implement 60 requests/minute per IP for API endpoints
   - Test rate limiting with curl/pytest
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: Rate limiting 60 requests/minute per IP

6. **Input Sanitization Review** (1 hour)
   - Audit Pydantic models for proper validation
   - Ensure Jinja2 auto-escaping enabled
   - Verify parameterized queries if any raw SQL exists
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: Input sanitization preventing XSS, injection attacks

7. **Audit Logging System** (1.5 hours)
   - Create FastAPI dependency for security event logging
   - Implement structured JSON logging to stdout
   - Apply to all security-relevant endpoints
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: Audit logging for all security-relevant events

#### Tier 3: Process & Tooling Integration (Hours 7-12) - External Dependencies

8. **.env GPG Encryption Integration** (1-2 hours)
   - Integrate existing `src/utils/encryption.py` pattern
   - Test encryption/decryption workflow
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: .env file encryption/decryption with GPG

9. **Dependency Vulnerability Scanning** (2 hours)
   - Integrate `safety check` and `bandit` in CI/CD pipeline
   - Configure automated scanning on PRs
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: Dependency vulnerability scanning integrated in CI/CD

10. **OWASP ZAP Security Testing** (3 hours - TIMEBOXED)
    - Implement ZAP baseline scan in GitHub Actions
    - Configure rules.tsv for false positive management
    - **Test-Driven Security**: Use ZAP alerts to validate header implementation
    - **Acceptance Criteria**: Security testing suite with OWASP ZAP integration

### OWASP ZAP Integration Strategy (IT Manager Approved)

**Hour 1**: Basic ZAP Action Setup
```yaml
- name: Start Server & Wait for Ready
  shell: bash
  run: |
    uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 &
    timeout 30s bash -c 'until curl -s -f -o /dev/null http://localhost:8000/docs; do sleep 2; done'

- name: OWASP ZAP Baseline Scan
  uses: zaproxy/action-baseline@v0.14.0
  with:
    target: 'http://localhost:8000/docs'
    fail_action: false  # Don't break CI during initial tuning
    allow_issue_writing: false  # Prevent GitHub issue spam
```

**Hour 2**: False Positive Management
- Create `.zap/rules.tsv` with expected FastAPI false positives:
  - `10011 IGNORE (Cookie Without Secure Flag)` - CI runs over HTTP
  - Use missing header alerts as validation that security middleware works

**Hour 3**: Testing and Documentation
- Run scan, tune rules, document remaining issues for Phase 2

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing (Throughout Implementation)
```bash
# Test security middleware
poetry run pytest tests/unit/test_security_middleware.py -v

# Test rate limiting
poetry run pytest tests/unit/test_rate_limiting.py -v

# Test audit logging
poetry run pytest tests/unit/test_audit_logging.py -v
```

### Integration Testing (Final Validation)
```bash
# Security validation script
poetry run python src/security/validation.py

# Vulnerability scanning
poetry run safety check
poetry run bandit -r src/ -f json

# ZAP baseline scan (in CI)
# Validates all security headers and configurations
```

### Performance Testing
```bash
# Rate limiting validation
for i in {1..70}; do curl -w "%{http_code}\n" http://localhost:8000/api/v1/create; done
# Should see 429 responses after 60 requests
```

## Phase 2 Security Recommendations

**HIGH PRIORITY (Next Sprint)**:
1. **User Authentication & Authorization** - Address highest risk gap
2. **SSL/TLS Enforcement** - Secure data in transit
3. **Production Security Configuration** - Environment-specific hardening

**MEDIUM PRIORITY**:
4. **Database Security Review** - Secure data at rest
5. **Comprehensive Penetration Testing** - External security validation
6. **Security Documentation** - Operational security procedures

## Implementation Notes

- **Reuse First**: Leverage proven patterns from ledgerbase/FISProject (30-minute validation spike)
- **Configure Don't Build**: Use established libraries (slowapi, existing encryption patterns)
- **Quality Focus**: Maintain 80%+ test coverage for all security components
- **Timeline Management**: Timebox ZAP integration to 3 hours maximum
- **Risk Awareness**: Document excluded security items for stakeholder transparency
