## üìà Execution Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (11 hours)
1. **Issue #1**: Development Environment Setup (6 hours)
2. **Issue #2**: Core Configuration System (5 hours)

### Phase 2: Core Framework (8 hours)  
3. **Issue #4**: C.R.E.A.T.E. Framework Engine (8 hours)
   - **BLOCKER CHECK**: Verify Zen MCP Server availability before starting

### Phase 3: UI and Templates (6 hours parallel)
4. **Issue #5** + **Issue #6**: Parallel execution (6 hours)
   - **BLOCKER CHECK**: Confirm PromptCraft repository access for Issue #5

### Phase 4: Testing Framework (6 hours)
5. **Issue #7**: Test Framework Implementation (6 hours)
   - **PREREQUISITE CHECK**: All acceptance criteria from Issues #4, #5, #6 validated

## üéØ Success Criteria for Starting Issue #7

Issue #7 can begin when ALL of the following conditions are met:

1. **‚úÖ All prerequisite issues completed** and acceptance criteria validated
2. **‚úÖ Zen MCP Server** is deployed, accessible, and responding to requests
3. **‚úÖ Template system** is operational with test data populated
4. **‚úÖ API endpoints** are functional and returning expected responses
5. **‚úÖ UI components** are working with backend integration
6. **‚úÖ Configuration system** is loading settings correctly
7. **‚úÖ Development environment** passes all validation checks

## üìä Risk Mitigation Actions

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Verify Zen MCP Server status** - Contact project owner/team
2. **Confirm template storage design** - Review/create architecture documentation  
3. **Validate PromptCraft repository access** - Ensure code reuse capability
4. **Check current issue completion status** - Audit what's already done

### Fallback Plans
- **If Zen MCP Server unavailable**: Consider mock/stub implementation for testing
- **If template system delayed**: Use minimal template set for testing
- **If PromptCraft access blocked**: Create UI from scratch (increases time estimate)

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: Do not begin Issue #7 until ALL prerequisites are confirmed complete and external dependencies are resolved. Starting without proper foundation will result in significant rework and delays.
