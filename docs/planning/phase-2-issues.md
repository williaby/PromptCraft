**Q3: How are conflicts resolved when multiple agents provide different recommendations?**
**A3: Confidence scoring system with human escalation for conflicts >30% difference**

**Q4: What are the specific performance requirements for multi-agent coordination?**
**A4: <5s for agent routing, <15s for multi-agent consensus, <500ms for state updates**

### Acceptance Criteria
