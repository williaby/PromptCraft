# Security Gates Deployment Announcement

## üõ°Ô∏è Enhanced Security: Security Gates Now Enforcing

### What's Changing

Starting **[DEPLOYMENT_DATE]**, our security gates will transition from **advisory** to **blocking** mode.
This means security scans must pass before code can be merged to protected branches.

### Why This Matters

‚úÖ **Stronger Security**: Prevents vulnerable code from reaching production
‚úÖ **Consistent Standards**: Ensures all code meets our security requirements
‚úÖ **Compliance**: Supports our security audit and compliance requirements
‚úÖ **Team Protection**: Catches security issues before they become incidents

### What You Need to Know

#### üö¶ Security Checks Now Required

These security scans must pass before merging:

- **CodeQL Analysis**: Static security analysis
- **Dependency Review**: Vulnerability scanning for dependencies
- **PR Validation**: Code quality and security policy compliance

#### üîß When Scans Fail

1. **Fix the Issue**: Address the security finding (preferred)
2. **Request Exception**: Use the exception process for false positives
3. **Emergency Override**: Use only for production emergencies

#### üìö Resources Available

- **Developer Guide**: `/docs/security/security-gates-guide.md`
- **Exception Process**: `.github/security-exceptions.yml`
- **Override Process**: `/docs/security/override-process.md`
- **Support Channel**: `#security-help`

### Exception Handling Process

#### For False Positives

1. Add exception to `.github/security-exceptions.yml`
2. Include detailed justification
3. Get security team approval
4. Set appropriate expiration date

#### Example Exception

```yaml
- id: "EX-001"
  type: "false-positive"
  tool: "codeql"
  rule: "py/sql-injection"
  file: "src/logging.py"
  line: 42
  justification: "This is a logging statement with no user input"
  risk_accepted: false
  expires: "2024-02-15"
  approved_by: "@security-team"
  approved_date: "2024-01-15"
  pr_reference: "#123"
```

### Emergency Override Process

#### When to Use

- **Production Down**: Critical system failures
- **Revenue Blocking**: Customer-facing issues
- **Security Incident**: Immediate security patches needed

#### How to Use

```bash
# Emergency override commit format
git commit -m "EMERGENCY_OVERRIDE: [Brief reason]

EXPIRES: $(date -d '+2 hours' -Iseconds)
APPROVER: @engineering-manager
JUSTIFICATION: Production payment system failure
TRACKING: #EMERGENCY-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M)"
```

### Frequently Asked Questions

#### Q: What if my PR is blocked?

**A**: First, try to fix the security issue. If it's a false positive, use the exception process. For urgent issues, emergency override is available.

#### Q: How long do exceptions take to approve?

**A**: Most exceptions are approved within 4 hours during business hours.
False positives are typically approved faster.

#### Q: Will this slow down development?

**A**: Initial impact is expected to be minimal. We're monitoring metrics and will tune the system based on feedback.

#### Q: What happens in production emergencies?

**A**: Emergency override process allows immediate deployment with 2-hour auto-expiry and required
follow-up.

#### Q: Who can I contact for help?

**A**: Use #security-help Slack channel or email <security-team@company.com>. For emergencies, call +1-800-SEC-HELP.

### Success Metrics We're Tracking
