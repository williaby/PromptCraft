# Security Gates Quick Reference Card

## 🚦 When Your PR is Blocked

### 1. Identify the Issue

```bash
# Check which security scan failed
gh pr checks [PR-NUMBER]

# Look for failed checks:
# - CodeQL Analysis
# - dependency-review
# - PR Validation
```

### 2. Fix or Request Exception

#### Option A: Fix the Security Issue (Preferred)

```bash
# Address the security finding
# Update dependencies: uv lock --upgrade
# Fix code issues: Follow CodeQL suggestions
# Run tests: uv run pytest
```

#### Option B: Request Exception (False Positives)

```yaml
# Add to .github/security-exceptions.yml
- id: "EX-[INCREMENT]"
  type: "false-positive"
  tool: "[SCAN_TOOL]"
  rule: "[RULE_NAME]"
  file: "[FILE_PATH]"
  line: [LINE_NUMBER]
  justification: "[WHY_FALSE_POSITIVE]"
  expires: "[YYYY-MM-DD]"
  approved_by: "@security-team"
  pr_reference: "#[PR_NUMBER]"
```

#### Option C: Emergency Override (Production Only)

```bash
# Use only for true emergencies
git commit -m "EMERGENCY_OVERRIDE: [BRIEF_REASON]

EXPIRES: $(date -d '+2 hours' -Iseconds)
APPROVER: @[MANAGER]
JUSTIFICATION: [DETAILED_REASON]"
```

## 🛠️ Common Security Issues & Fixes

### CodeQL Issues

| Issue | Quick Fix |
|-------|-----------|
| SQL Injection | Use parameterized queries |
| XSS | Escape user input properly |
| Path Traversal | Validate file paths |
| Hardcoded Secrets | Use environment variables |

### Dependency Issues

| Issue | Quick Fix |
|-------|-----------|
| Vulnerable Package | `uv lock --upgrade-package [package]` |
| High-Risk CVE | Check for security patches |
| Outdated Dependencies | `uv lock --upgrade` |

### Example Fixes

```python
# ❌ SQL Injection Risk
query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {user_id}"

# ✅ Safe Parameterized Query
query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = %s"
cursor.execute(query, (user_id,))

# ❌ XSS Risk
return f"<div>Hello {user_name}</div>"

# ✅ Escaped Output
return f"<div>Hello {html.escape(user_name)}</div>"
```

## 📋 Exception Request Template

```yaml
# Copy this template to .github/security-exceptions.yml
- id: "EX-XXX"  # Increment number
  type: "false-positive"  # or "accepted-risk" | "pending-fix"
  tool: "codeql"  # or "dependency-review" | "pr-validation"
  rule: "py/sql-injection"  # Specific rule that triggered
  file: "src/models/user.py"  # Full file path
  line: 45  # Line number (if applicable)
  justification: "This query uses safe ORM methods with no user input"
  risk_accepted: false  # true for accepted-risk type
  expires: "2024-03-15"  # YYYY-MM-DD format
  approved_by: "@security-team"  # GitHub username
  approved_date: "2024-01-15"  # When approved
  pr_reference: "#456"  # Link to PR
  # mitigation: "Additional context for accepted risks"
```

## 🚨 Emergency Override Decision Tree

```text
Is this a true emergency?
├─ NO → Use exception process
└─ YES → Is production affected?
    ├─ YES → EMERGENCY_OVERRIDE (2h max)
    └─ NO → Is revenue at risk?
        ├─ YES → Revenue override (6h max)
        └─ NO → Standard override (48h max)
```

### Emergency Override Types

| Type | Duration | Approver | Use Case |
|------|----------|----------|----------|
| Production Down | 2 hours | Engineering Manager | System outage |
| Security Fix | 4 hours | Security Lead | Critical patch |
| Revenue Blocking | 6 hours | Director | Customer impact |

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Prevent Issues Early

1. **Run security checks locally** before pushing
2. **Keep dependencies updated** regularly
3. **Follow secure coding standards**
4. **Use IDE security plugins** for real-time feedback

### Speed Up Resolution

1. **Read the error message** carefully
2. **Check if it's a known false positive** in exceptions file
3. **Ask in #security-help** before guessing
4. **Include context** when requesting help

### Best Practices

1. **Fix real issues** rather than requesting exceptions
2. **Be specific** in exception justifications
3. **Set reasonable expiry dates** for exceptions
4. **Follow up** on pending fixes
