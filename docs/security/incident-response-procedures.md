# Security Incident Response Procedures

## Overview

This document outlines comprehensive procedures for responding to security incidents in the PromptCraft Hybrid system. It provides structured workflows for incident detection, classification, containment, eradication, and recovery.

## Incident Classification System

### Severity Levels

#### **Critical (P0)**
- **Response Time**: Immediate (< 15 minutes)
- **Examples**: Data breach, system compromise, service unavailable
- **Escalation**: Immediately notify all stakeholders

#### **High (P1)**
- **Response Time**: < 1 hour
- **Examples**: Authentication bypass, privilege escalation, significant data exposure
- **Escalation**: Notify security team and management within 30 minutes

#### **Medium (P2)**
- **Response Time**: < 4 hours
- **Examples**: Failed login attempts, suspicious activity patterns, minor data exposure
- **Escalation**: Log incident and notify security team

#### **Low (P3)**
- **Response Time**: < 24 hours
- **Examples**: Policy violations, configuration drift, informational alerts
- **Escalation**: Standard logging and review process

### Incident Types

1. **Authentication Incidents**
   - Brute force attacks
   - Account takeover attempts
   - Failed authentication spikes
   - Service token compromise

2. **Access Control Incidents**
   - Privilege escalation attempts
   - Unauthorized resource access
   - Permission bypass attempts
   - Role manipulation

3. **Data Security Incidents**
   - Data exfiltration attempts
   - Unauthorized data access
   - Data integrity violations
   - Privacy breaches

4. **System Security Incidents**
   - Malware detection
   - System compromise
   - Configuration tampering
   - Service disruption

    A[Security Event Detected] --> B{Severity Assessment}
    B -->|Critical/High| C[Immediate Alert]
    B -->|Medium/Low| D[Standard Alert]

    E --> G[Notify On-Call Team]
    F --> H[Queue for Review]

    G --> I[Incident Response Team Activated]
    H --> J[Standard Investigation]
```

### 2. Containment Actions by Incident Type

#### Authentication Incidents
- **Account Lockout**: Automatically lock compromised accounts
- **IP Blocking**: Block suspicious IP addresses for 1-24 hours
- **Rate Limiting**: Apply aggressive rate limiting to affected endpoints
- **Session Termination**: Invalidate all sessions for compromised accounts

#### Access Control Incidents
- **Permission Revocation**: Remove elevated permissions immediately
- **Role Suspension**: Temporarily suspend affected user roles
- **Resource Isolation**: Isolate accessed resources from network
- **Audit Trail Lock**: Secure audit logs for forensic analysis

#### Data Security Incidents
- **Data Classification**: Immediately classify exposed data sensitivity
- **Access Monitoring**: Enhanced monitoring of data access patterns
- **Backup Isolation**: Isolate backups to prevent lateral movement
- **Legal Notification**: Trigger legal/compliance notification workflow
