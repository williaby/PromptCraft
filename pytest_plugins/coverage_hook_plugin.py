Pytest Coverage Hook Plugin

This pytest plugin automatically detects when tests are run with coverage
and triggers the enhanced coverage report generation. It integrates seamlessly
with VS Code's "Run Tests with Coverage" workflow.

Features:
- Automatically detects coverage runs via pytest hooks
- Triggers enhanced report generation after test completion
- Works with both CLI and VS Code test execution
- No manual intervention required
- Handles errors gracefully

Usage:
This plugin is automatically loaded when pytest runs if the pytest_plugins
directory is in the Python path and the plugin is installed.

Integration with VS Code:
- VS Code runs: pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html --cov-report=xml
- Plugin detects coverage arguments
- After tests complete, plugin triggers report generation
- Enhanced reports appear in reports/coverage/ directory
