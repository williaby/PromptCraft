Automated Coverage Report Generator for VS Code Integration

This script provides a simple interface to generate detailed coverage reports
after running tests in VS Code. It handles the timing and file detection
automatically.

Usage:
    python scripts/auto_coverage_report.py

Integration with VS Code:
    1. Run "Run Tests with Coverage" in VS Code
    2. Run this script to get detailed reports
    3. Open the generated HTML reports for analysis
