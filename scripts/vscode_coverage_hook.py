VS Code Coverage Integration Hook

This script is called automatically by VS Code after running tests with coverage.
It triggers the fast coverage report generation to update all HTML reports.

Usage:
- Configured as VS Code task in .vscode/tasks.json
- Can be integrated with pytest plugins
- Supports both automatic and manual execution
- Enhanced with coverage contexts support

Integration Options:
1. VS Code Task: Bound to keyboard shortcut or run manually
2. Pytest Plugin: Automatic execution after test runs
3. File Watcher: Continuous monitoring for changes
