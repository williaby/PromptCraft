## Critical Missing Test Categories

### 1. API Router Integration Tests
- **Missing**: Complete absence of tests for 8 out of 9 API routers
- **Impact**: 0% coverage for critical user-facing endpoints
- **Required**: Integration tests for all API endpoints with FastAPI test client

### 2. Performance Test Coverage
- **Current**: 4 failed performance tests
- **Missing**: Load testing, stress testing, concurrent access validation
- **Required**: Performance benchmarks for all critical security operations

### 3. Auth-marked Tests
- **Current**: Only 1 auth-marked test for entire AUTH-4 system
- **Missing**: Authentication flow tests, authorization validation, token management
- **Required**: Comprehensive auth workflow testing

### 4. Infrastructure Testing
- **Missing**: Service container, dependency injection, FastAPI integration
- **Impact**: Core infrastructure untested
- **Required**: Integration tests for service bootstrap and container management

## Test Quality Assessment

### Existing Test Strengths
1. **Core Security Components**: Good coverage for security_monitor, security_logger
2. **JWT Validation**: 100% coverage for authentication core
3. **Model Validation**: 93.40% coverage for data models

### Test Quality Issues
1. **Performance Tests**: 4 failing tests indicate implementation gaps
2. **Integration Testing**: Only 15 integration tests for 35+ source files
3. **Mock Strategy**: Inconsistent mocking approach across services
4. **Test Isolation**: Potential dependency issues in failing performance tests

## Critical Gaps Prioritization

### Priority 1: API Router Testing (BLOCKING)
- 8 routers with 0% coverage
- Critical user-facing functionality untested
- Required for production readiness

### Priority 2: Infrastructure Testing (HIGH)
- Service container, bootstrap, FastAPI integration
- Core system reliability at risk
- Required for deployment confidence

### Priority 3: Performance & Load Testing (HIGH) 
- Current performance tests failing
- No load/stress testing validation
- Required for scalability assurance

### Priority 4: Database Layer Testing (MEDIUM)
- PostgreSQL integration undertested (19.74%)
- Data persistence reliability concerns
- Required for data integrity

### Priority 5: Enhanced Auth Flow Testing (MEDIUM)
- Only 1 auth-marked test
- Authentication workflows need validation
- Required for security assurance
