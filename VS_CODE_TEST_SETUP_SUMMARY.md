# VS Code Python Test Setup - Issue Resolution Summary

## Problem Identified

VS Code was not recognizing pytest tests due to incorrect Python interpreter and pytest executable paths. The main issues were:

1. **Incorrect Python Interpreter Path**: Settings pointed to `.venv/bin/python` but the actual Poetry virtual environment was located at `/home/byron/.cache/pypoetry/virtualenvs/promptcraft-hybrid-ww18U7e4-py3.11/`
2. **Poetry Command Configuration**: VS Code was trying to use `["poetry", "run", "pytest"]` which doesn't work well for the Test Explorer
3. **Coverage Configuration**: Default pytest runs were failing due to 80% coverage requirement, making test discovery difficult

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Fixed Python Interpreter Path

**Before:**
```json
"python.defaultInterpreterPath": ".venv/bin/python"
```

**After:**
```json
"python.defaultInterpreterPath": "/home/byron/.cache/pypoetry/virtualenvs/promptcraft-hybrid-ww18U7e4-py3.11/bin/python"
```

### 2. Fixed Pytest Executable Path

**Before:**
```json
"python.testing.pytest.path": [
    "poetry",
    "run",
    "pytest"
]
```

**After:**
```json
"python.testing.pytest.path": "/home/byron/.cache/pypoetry/virtualenvs/promptcraft-hybrid-ww18U7e4-py3.11/bin/pytest"
```

### 3. Added Coverage Bypass for VS Code Testing

**Added:**
```json
"python.testing.pytestArgs": [
    "tests",
    "--no-cov"
]
```

This allows VS Code test discovery and execution without being blocked by the 80% coverage requirement.

### 4. Removed Redundant Configuration

**Removed:**
```json
"python.testing.pytestPaths": [
    "tests/examples",
    "tests/unit/utils",
    "tests/unit",
    "tests"
]
```

This was redundant since `testpaths = ["tests"]` is already configured in `pyproject.toml`.

## Final Working Configuration

```json
{
    "mcp": {
        "inputs": [],
        "servers": {
            "mcp-server-time": {
                "command": "python",
                "args": [
                    "-m",
                    "mcp_server_time",
                    "--local-timezone=America/Los_Angeles"
                ],
                "env": {}
            }
        }
    },
    "python.testing.pytestEnabled": true,
    "python.testing.unittestEnabled": false,
    "python.testing.pytestArgs": [
        "tests",
        "--no-cov"
    ],
    "python.testing.autoTestDiscoverOnSaveEnabled": true,
    "python.testing.pytest.path": "/home/byron/.cache/pypoetry/virtualenvs/promptcraft-hybrid-ww18U7e4-py3.11/bin/pytest",
    "python.defaultInterpreterPath": "/home/byron/.cache/pypoetry/virtualenvs/promptcraft-hybrid-ww18U7e4-py3.11/bin/python",
    "python.testing.cwd": "${workspaceFolder}",
    "python.envFile": "${workspaceFolder}/.env",
    "python.analysis.extraPaths": [
        "src"
    ],
    "python.analysis.autoImportCompletions": true
}
```

## Verification

The configuration was verified using a custom script (`test_vscode_integration.py`) that confirmed:

✅ **Python version check** - Python 3.11.13
✅ **Pytest version check** - pytest 8.4.1
✅ **Test discovery** - Successfully discovered tests
✅ **Single test execution** - Tests run correctly without coverage blocking

## Next Steps for User

1. **Reload VS Code window**: `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Developer: Reload Window"
2. **Open Test Explorer**: `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Test: Focus on Test Explorer View"
3. **Verify test discovery**: Tests should now appear in the Test Explorer
4. **Run tests**: Click the play button next to individual tests or test classes

## Coverage Note

For full test suite runs with coverage (required for CI/CD), continue using:
```bash
poetry run pytest -v --cov=src --cov-report=html --cov-report=term-missing
```

The `--no-cov` flag in VS Code settings only affects Test Explorer execution, not command-line usage.

## Files Modified

- `.vscode/settings.json` - Updated Python and pytest paths, added coverage bypass
- `test_vscode_integration.py` - Created verification script (can be deleted)
- `VS_CODE_TEST_SETUP_SUMMARY.md` - This documentation file

The issue has been resolved and VS Code should now properly recognize and execute pytest tests.
