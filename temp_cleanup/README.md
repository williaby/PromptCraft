# Temporary Cleanup Directory

This directory contains temporary files that were created during development and testing phases. These files should be reviewed before deciding whether to keep them in the proper directory structure or remove them entirely.

## Current Files

### test_remediation_fixes.py
**Status**: Moved from project root
**Purpose**: Quick test runner for Phase 1 Issue 5 remediation fixes
**Description**: Performs basic validation of security and functionality fixes implemented to address critical issues identified by multi-agent review.

**Review Decision Needed**:
- Move to `tests/unit/` if this should be part of the permanent test suite
- Remove if this was only needed for temporary validation

### test_vscode_integration.py
**Status**: Moved from project root
**Purpose**: VS Code Python Test Integration Verification Script
**Description**: Verifies that VS Code can properly discover and run tests using the configured pytest environment.

**Review Decision Needed**:
- Move to `scripts/` if this should be kept as a development utility
- Remove if this was only needed for one-time VS Code setup verification

## Review Guidelines

1. **Evaluate Purpose**: Determine if the file serves an ongoing purpose or was temporary
2. **Check Dependencies**: Ensure any imports or paths are valid if moving to permanent location
3. **Test Integration**: Verify the file works correctly in its intended location
4. **Documentation**: Update any references to these files in project documentation

## Cleanup Instructions

After review:
- Move useful files to their proper permanent location
- Update any documentation that references these files
- Remove files that are no longer needed
- Delete this cleanup directory once empty
