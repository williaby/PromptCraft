```

### Test Execution
```bash
# Run all AUTH-4 related tests
poetry run pytest tests/unit/auth/ -v --cov=src/auth

# Run integration tests
poetry run pytest tests/integration/test_auth4_security_workflow.py -v

# Run performance tests
poetry run pytest tests/performance/test_auth4_performance_requirements.py -v
```

## üöÄ Deployment Notes

### Environment Variables Required
```bash
# Security Configuration
SECURITY_LOG_LEVEL=INFO
SECURITY_ALERT_THRESHOLD=5
SECURITY_MONITORING_ENABLED=true

# Database Configuration
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@localhost/promptcraft
DATABASE_POOL_SIZE=20
DATABASE_MAX_OVERFLOW=40

# Alert Channels (Optional)
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=https://hooks.slack.com/...
EMAIL_SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
```

### Migration Requirements
```bash
# Run database migrations
poetry run alembic upgrade head

# Verify security tables
poetry run python scripts/verify_security_schema.py
```

## üìå Related Issues

- Closes #AUTH-4: Enhanced Security Event Logging
- Related to #AUTH-1: Cloudflare Access JWT Authentication
- Related to #AUTH-2: Service Token Management
- Part of Phase 1 completion

## ‚úÖ Checklist

- [x] Code follows project style guidelines
- [x] All tests pass locally
- [x] Test coverage maintained at 80%+
- [x] Documentation updated
- [x] Security review completed
- [x] Performance benchmarks pass
- [x] Database migrations tested
- [x] No sensitive data exposed
- [x] Linting passes (`poetry run black .`, `poetry run ruff check .`)
- [x] Type checking passes (`poetry run mypy src`)

## üîÑ Phase Integration

This AUTH-4 implementation integrates with:
- **AUTH-1**: JWT validation and user context
- **AUTH-2**: Service token verification
- **Issue #5**: Gradio UI security dashboard
- **Issue #9**: Agent system security monitoring

## üìà Performance Impact

- **Startup Time**: +0.2s (acceptable, security service initialization)
- **Request Latency**: +2-5ms (security event logging)
- **Database Load**: ~100 events/second sustained capability
- **Memory Usage**: +15MB (service container overhead)

## üîí Security Considerations

- All security events are logged asynchronously to prevent blocking
- Rate limiting prevents log flooding attacks
- Sensitive data is redacted from logs
- Database connections use SSL/TLS
- Service tokens are never logged in plaintext

## üëÄ Notes for Reviewers

This is a **phase completion PR** that includes the full AUTH-4 implementation along with all Phase 1 features. The PR is intentionally large as it represents the completion of an entire development phase.

### Review Focus Areas
1. **Security Event Schema** - Verify event structure meets requirements
2. **Service Architecture** - Review dependency injection patterns
3. **Test Coverage** - Ensure comprehensive testing of security features
4. **Performance** - Validate async patterns and database queries
5. **Error Handling** - Check proper exception handling and recovery

### Known Limitations
- Alert email delivery requires SMTP configuration (optional)
- Slack integration requires webhook URL (optional)
- Full dashboard visualization pending Issue #5 completion
