# SECURITY SETTINGS
# ==============================================================================

# Lock the registry to the official public npm registry.
# This is a critical security measure to prevent "dependency confusion" attacks,
# where npm could otherwise be tricked into downloading a malicious package from
# a private source if it has the same name as a public package.

# Fail the 'npm audit' command if vulnerabilities of 'high' severity or greater
# are found. This encourages developers to fix critical vulnerabilities before
# pushing code.

# ==============================================================================
# DEPENDENCY & BUILD SETTINGS
# ==============================================================================

# By default, when a developer runs 'npm install <package>', this setting ensures
# that the exact version number is saved to package.json (e.g., "1.2.3")
# instead of a version range (e.g., "^1.2.3"). This prevents unexpected changes
# from minor package updates and leads to more deterministic, reproducible builds.
