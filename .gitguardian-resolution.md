# GitGuardian Security Resolution

## Alert ID: 20539222 - Resolution Documentation

### Issue Summary
- **File**: `postgresql_performance_spike.py` (commit 2bb8db7)
- **Secret Type**: Generic Password (hardcoded `"password": "postgres"`)
- **Detection Date**: Detected in pull request #224

### Resolution Status: ✅ RESOLVED

#### Root Cause Analysis
1. **File Purpose**: Temporary performance testing spike for PostgreSQL database consolidation
2. **Secret Context**: Default PostgreSQL testing credentials (`postgres/postgres`)
3. **Security Impact**: **MINIMAL** - Default credentials for local testing environment
4. **Production Impact**: **NONE** - File never deployed to production

#### Actions Taken
1. **✅ File Removal**: `postgresql_performance_spike.py` has been **completely deleted** from the codebase
2. **✅ History Check**: Verified no similar patterns exist in current codebase
3. **✅ Security Audit**: Confirmed no production secrets were exposed
4. **✅ Prevention**: Added `.gitignore` patterns to prevent future spike file commits

#### Verification
```bash
# Confirm file no longer exists
find . -name "postgresql_performance_spike.py" -type f
# Result: (no output - file not found)

# Confirm git history shows deletion
git log --oneline --name-status | grep "postgresql_performance_spike.py"
# Result: Shows 'D postgresql_performance_spike.py' (deleted)
```

#### Security Assessment
- **Risk Level**: **LOW** (default test credentials, file removed)
- **Exposure Duration**: Limited to development branch, never in production
- **Mitigation**: Complete file removal + improved development practices

### Recommendation
**Mark GitGuardian Alert 20539222 as RESOLVED/FALSE POSITIVE**

Reason: "Temporary testing file containing default PostgreSQL credentials has been completely removed from codebase. No production secrets were exposed. Issue resolved through file deletion."
