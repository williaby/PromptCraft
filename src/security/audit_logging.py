"""Audit logging system for security events.

This module provides comprehensive audit logging capabilities for tracking
security-relevant events throughout the application lifecycle.
It implements structured logging with JSON formatting, automatic severity
mapping, and comprehensive event classification for security monitoring.

The module provides:
- Structured audit event data models with automatic metadata extraction
- Configurable severity levels for proper alerting and response
- Specialized logging methods for common security events
- JSON-formatted output for log aggregation systems
- Client IP extraction with proxy header support
- Thread-safe logging operations

Architecture:
    The audit logging system uses structlog for structured JSON logging
    with automatic timestamp formatting and exception handling. Events are
    classified by type and severity for efficient monitoring and analysis.

Key Components:
    - AuditEvent: Structured event data model with metadata
    - AuditLogger: Centralized logging system with specialized methods
    - AuditEventType: Enumeration of all trackable event types
    - AuditEventSeverity: Severity levels for alerting and response
    - Convenience functions: Simplified interface for common events

Dependencies:
    - structlog: For structured JSON logging and metadata handling
    - fastapi: For Request object processing and context extraction
    - src.config.settings: For environment-specific configuration
    - datetime: For ISO timestamp generation

Called by:
    - src.security.middleware: For request/response logging
    - src.security.rate_limiting: For rate limit violation logging
    - src.security.error_handlers: For error event logging
    - Authentication systems: For login/logout event tracking
    - API endpoints: For access control and data operation logging

Complexity: O(1) for event creation and logging, O(n) for header processing where n is header count
