"""
Query Counselor for PromptCraft-Hybrid.

This module implements the query counseling and routing system that analyzes user queries
and determines the most appropriate processing path within the PromptCraft ecosystem.
It serves as the intelligent dispatcher that understands query intent and routes requests
to the optimal combination of agents and processing pipelines.

The Query Counselor provides:
- Query intent analysis and classification
- Agent selection and routing logic
- Query preprocessing and enhancement
- Multi-agent orchestration coordination
- Response aggregation and post-processing

Architecture:
    The QueryCounselor acts as the central intelligence hub that bridges user queries
    with the appropriate agents and processing pipelines. It integrates with the
    HyDE processor for enhanced retrieval and coordinates with the Zen MCP system
    for robust error handling and resilience.

Key Components:
    - Intent classification using NLP techniques
    - Agent capability matching and selection
    - Query enhancement and preprocessing
    - Multi-agent workflow orchestration
    - Response synthesis and quality assurance

Dependencies:
    - src.agents.registry: For agent discovery and selection
    - src.core.hyde_processor: For enhanced query processing
    - src.core.zen_mcp_error_handling: For resilient execution
    - External AI services: For intent analysis and classification

Called by:
    - src/main.py: Primary FastAPI endpoint handlers
    - Agent orchestration systems
    - Query processing pipelines
    - Multi-agent coordination workflows

Complexity: O(n*m) where n is number of available agents and m is query complexity
