"""
HyDE (Hypothetical Document Embeddings) Processor for PromptCraft-Hybrid.

This module implements the HyDE-enhanced retrieval system that improves semantic search
accuracy through three-tier query analysis and hypothetical document generation.
HyDE enhances traditional RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) by generating hypothetical
documents that better match the embedding space of relevant knowledge.

The HyDE processor provides:
- Three-tier query analysis system
- Hypothetical document generation
- Enhanced semantic embedding creation
- Improved retrieval accuracy
- Multi-modal query processing

Architecture:
    The HyDE system processes queries through three progressive tiers:
    1. Direct query embedding for simple semantic matches
    2. Query expansion and reformulation for complex queries
    3. Hypothetical document generation for advanced retrieval

    This tiered approach ensures optimal retrieval performance across different
    query types and complexity levels.

Key Components:
    - Query classification and tier selection
    - Hypothetical document generation using AI models
    - Enhanced embedding creation and indexing
    - Multi-tier retrieval strategy implementation
    - Result ranking and relevance scoring

Dependencies:
    - External AI services: For document generation and embedding
    - src.config.settings: For HyDE configuration parameters
    - Qdrant vector database: For enhanced semantic search
    - src.core.zen_mcp_error_handling: For resilient processing

Called by:
    - src.core.query_counselor: For enhanced query processing
    - Agent implementations: For improved knowledge retrieval
    - RAG pipeline components: For semantic search enhancement
    - Knowledge ingestion systems: For embedding optimization

Complexity: O(k*n) where k is number of tiers and n is query/document complexity
