"""
Hybrid Router for OpenRouter and MCP Integration.

Provides intelligent routing between OpenRouter and MCP services with gradual rollout,
circuit breaker protection, and comprehensive monitoring. Implements the MCPClientInterface
for seamless integration into the PromptCraft system.

Key Features:
    - Deterministic hash-based routing for gradual rollout
    - OpenRouter primary, MCP fallback strategy
    - Circuit breaker integration for failure detection
    - Performance monitoring and metrics collection
    - Load balancing across available models
    - Configurable traffic percentage for safe deployment

Architecture:
    The HybridRouter acts as a intelligent proxy between the application and
    multiple AI service providers, making routing decisions based on:
    - Request characteristics and requirements
    - Service health and availability
    - Configured rollout percentages
    - Circuit breaker state
    - Performance metrics and SLA requirements

Time Complexity: O(1) for routing decisions, O(n) for workflow orchestration
Space Complexity: O(k) where k is the number of active connections
