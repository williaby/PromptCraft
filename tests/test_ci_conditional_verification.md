# CI Conditional Verification Test Scenarios

## Test Scenarios for Conditional Requirements Verification

### Scenario 1: Feature Branch CI (Should Skip Verification)

**Expected Behavior**: CI runs normally but skips requirements verification step
**Test Conditions**:

- Branch: `feature/some-feature`
- CI Trigger: Push or PR to feature branch
- Expected Result: `Verify requirements.txt hasn't changed` step is skipped

### Scenario 2: Main Branch CI (Should Run Verification)

**Expected Behavior**: Full CI including requirements verification
**Test Conditions**:

- Branch: `main`
- CI Trigger: Push to main
- Expected Result: `Verify requirements.txt hasn't changed` step executes

### Scenario 3: Develop Branch CI (Should Run Verification)

**Expected Behavior**: Full CI including requirements verification
**Test Conditions**:

- Branch: `develop`
- CI Trigger: Push to develop
- Expected Result: `Verify requirements.txt hasn't changed` step executes

### Scenario 4: PR to Main (Should Run PR Validation)

**Expected Behavior**: PR validation workflow runs and checks requirements sync
**Test Conditions**:

- Action: Create PR targeting main branch
- Changes: No poetry.lock changes
- Expected Result: PR validation skips requirements check with success message

### Scenario 5: PR to Main with Poetry Changes (Should Validate Requirements)

**Expected Behavior**: PR validation detects poetry.lock changes and validates requirements
**Test Conditions**:

- Action: Create PR targeting main branch
- Changes: poetry.lock modified
- Expected Result: PR validation runs requirements sync check

### Scenario 6: PR to Develop with Out-of-Sync Requirements (Should Fail)

**Expected Behavior**: PR validation fails with clear error message
**Test Conditions**:

- Action: Create PR targeting develop branch
- Changes: poetry.lock modified but requirements.txt not updated
- Expected Result: PR validation fails with instructions to fix

## Edge Cases

### Edge Case 1: Empty Requirements Files

**Test**: What happens if requirements.txt is empty or missing?
**Expected**: Graceful failure with clear error message

### Edge Case 2: Invalid Poetry.lock

**Test**: What happens with corrupted poetry.lock?
**Expected**: Poetry commands fail early with diagnostic info

### Edge Case 3: Branch Name Variations

**Test**: Branch names like `main-hotfix`, `develop-test`
**Expected**: Verification only runs for exact `main` and `develop` matches

## Manual Test Commands

```bash
# Test CI condition locally (simulate GitHub Actions environment)
export GITHUB_REF="refs/heads/main"
if [[ "$GITHUB_REF" == "refs/heads/main" ]] || [[ "$GITHUB_REF" == "refs/heads/develop" ]]; then
    echo "Would run verification"
else
    echo "Would skip verification"
fi

# Test requirements generation
./scripts/generate_requirements.sh

# Test requirements sync check
git diff --exit-code requirements*.txt
echo "Exit code: $?"

# Test PR validation logic
git diff --name-only HEAD~1..HEAD | grep -q "poetry.lock"
echo "Poetry changed: $?"
```
