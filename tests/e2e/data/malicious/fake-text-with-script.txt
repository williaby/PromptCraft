This appears to be a normal text file but contains potentially malicious content:

<script>alert('XSS attempt in text file')</script>

<iframe src="javascript:alert('iframe XSS')"></iframe>

<img src="x" onerror="alert('img XSS')">

<svg onload="alert('svg XSS')">

Some legitimate content mixed in...

But also contains suspicious patterns:
- SQL injection attempt: '; DROP TABLE users; --
- Command injection: $(cat /etc/passwd)
- Path traversal: ../../../etc/passwd

This file tests the system's ability to detect and sanitize potentially dangerous content even in text files.
