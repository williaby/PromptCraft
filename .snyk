# Security review schedule:
# Next review: December 11, 2025
# Review items:
# 1. Check if PyTorch security patches have been released
# 2. Evaluate alternative ML libraries
# 3. Reassess risk tolerance based on deployment patterns
# 4. Consider removing ML features if not actively used

# Justification for risk acceptance:
# - PyTorch vulnerabilities only affect optional ML features
# - Production deployments can avoid risk by not installing ML dependencies
# - Most vulnerabilities require local access (limited attack surface)
# - No remote code execution vulnerabilities identified
# - Alternative mitigation strategies documented in SECURITY.md
