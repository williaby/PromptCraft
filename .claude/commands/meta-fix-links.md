# Fix Document Links

Analyze and fix broken internal links in: $ARGUMENTS

## Analysis Required

1. **Identify all internal links** in the specified file(s):
   - Relative links: `[text](./path/file.md)`
   - Absolute repo links: `[text](/docs/path/file.md)`
   - Parent directory links: `[text](../file.md)`
   - Anchor links: `[text](#heading-name)`

2. **Validate each link target**:
   - Check if target file exists
   - Verify anchor links point to valid headings
   - Identify broken or outdated references

3. **Suggest fixes for broken links**:
   - Use fuzzy matching to find similar filenames
   - Check for moved or renamed files
   - Provide correct relative paths
