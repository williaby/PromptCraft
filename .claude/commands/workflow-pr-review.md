# Workflow PR Review

Adaptive GitHub PR review with intelligent scaling, error handling, and early exit for clear cases: $ARGUMENTS

## Usage Options

- `<pr-url>` - Adaptive analysis (starts light, escalates if needed)
- `<pr-url> quick` - Essential review only (quality gates + basic analysis)
- `<pr-url> thorough` - Full multi-agent analysis regardless of complexity
- `<pr-url> security-focus` - Security-focused review with additional security agents
- `<pr-url> performance-focus` - Performance-focused review with optimization analysis

## Prerequisites

### Environment Prerequisites Validation

1. **Validate PR Review Environment**:

   ```bash
   # MANDATORY: Validate environment before review
   poetry run python src/utils/setup_validator.py --scope pr-review
   ```

2. **Required Access**:
   - GitHub API access for PR data fetching
   - Zen MCP Server running for agent orchestration
   - Context7 server for codebase analysis (if available)

3. **File Change Logging** (MANDATORY):
   - Log ALL file changes to `docs/planning/claude-file-change-log.md`
   - Format: `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS | CHANGE_TYPE | RELATIVE_FILE_PATH`

## Instructions

### Step 1: Smart PR Analysis & Early Assessment

1. **Extract PR Information with Error Handling**:
   - Parse GitHub PR URL: $ARGUMENTS and extract mode (quick/thorough/security-focus/performance-focus)
   - Use GitHub CLI with fallback strategies:


     TOTAL_LINES=$((additions + deletions))
     FILE_COUNT=$(echo "$files" | jq length)

     if [[ $TOTAL_LINES -gt 20000 || $FILE_COUNT -gt 50 ]]; then
         echo "üîç Large PR detected ($TOTAL_LINES lines, $FILE_COUNT files) - using sampling strategy"
         ANALYSIS_MODE="sampled"
     else
         ANALYSIS_MODE="full"
     fi
     ```

2. **Early Exit Detection**:
   - Check CI/CD status first - if critical failures exist, provide immediate feedback
   - Run basic quality gates (linting, security) before expensive analysis
   - For clear-cut cases (multiple failing checks + obvious violations), skip multi-agent analysis

### Step 2: Adaptive Quality Gate Validation

1. **Progressive Quality Checks with Early Exit**:

   ```bash
   echo "üîç Running quality gates..."

   # Start with fastest checks first
   QUALITY_ISSUES=0



   # CI/CD Status Check (fastest)
   if gh pr checks $PR_NUMBER | grep -q "fail"; then
       echo "‚ùå CI/CD checks failing - blocking issues detected"
       QUALITY_ISSUES=$((QUALITY_ISSUES + 1))
   fi



   # File-type specific linting (sample core files for large PRs)
   if [[ $ANALYSIS_MODE == "sampled" ]]; then
       # Focus on core changed files only
       CORE_FILES=$(gh pr view $PR_NUMBER --json files | \
         jq -r '.files[] | select(.path | test("(src/|tests/).*\\.(py|md|yml|yaml)$")) | .path' | head -10)

   


   # File-type specific linting (sample core files for large PRs)
   if [[ $ANALYSIS_MODE == "sampled" ]]; then
       # Focus on core changed files only
       CORE_FILES=$(gh pr view $PR_NUMBER --json files | jq -r '.files[] | select(.path | test("(src/|tests/).*\\.(py|md|yml|yaml)$")) | .path' | head -10)

   else
       # Full analysis for smaller PRs
       CORE_FILES=$(gh pr view $PR_NUMBER --json files | jq -r '.files[].path')
   fi


   



   # Run linting with progress indicators
   for file in $CORE_FILES; do
       echo "  üìã Checking $file..."
       case "$file" in


           *.py)
               poetry run ruff check "$file" 2>/dev/null || QUALITY_ISSUES=$((QUALITY_ISSUES + 1))
               ;;
           *.md)
               markdownlint "$file" 2>/dev/null || QUALITY_ISSUES=$((QUALITY_ISSUES + 1))
               ;;
           *.yml|*.yaml)

           *.py) 

           *.py)

               poetry run ruff check "$file" 2>/dev/null || QUALITY_ISSUES=$((QUALITY_ISSUES + 1))
               ;;
           *.md)
               markdownlint "$file" 2>/dev/null || QUALITY_ISSUES=$((QUALITY_ISSUES + 1))
               ;;

           *.yml|*.yaml) 


           *.yml|*.yaml)

               yamllint "$file" 2>/dev/null || QUALITY_ISSUES=$((QUALITY_ISSUES + 1))
               ;;
       esac
   done


   



   # Early exit for clear rejection cases
   if [[ $QUALITY_ISSUES -gt 10 ]]; then
       echo "üö´ Major quality issues detected ($QUALITY_ISSUES violations) - providing immediate feedback"
       SKIP_MULTI_AGENT=true
   fi
   ```



### Step 3: Conditional Multi-Agent Analysis

### Step 3: Conditional Multi-Agent Analysis 

### Step 3: Conditional Multi-Agent Analysis



**Note**: This step is only executed if `SKIP_MULTI_AGENT` is false (quality issues < 10)

1. **Intelligent Agent Selection Based on PR Characteristics**:



   ```bash
   # Determine which agents are needed based on PR content
   AGENTS_NEEDED=()

   if [[ $MODE == "security-focus" ]] || grep -q "auth\|security\|encrypt\|token" <<< "$PR_DESCRIPTION"; then
       AGENTS_NEEDED+=("security")
   fi

   if [[ $MODE == "performance-focus" ]] || grep -q "performance\|optimize\|cache\|database" <<< "$PR_DESCRIPTION"; then
       AGENTS_NEEDED+=("performance")
   fi




   ```bash
   # Determine which agents are needed based on PR content
   AGENTS_NEEDED=()

   if [[ $MODE == "security-focus" ]] || grep -q "auth\|security\|encrypt\|token" <<< "$PR_DESCRIPTION"; then
       AGENTS_NEEDED+=("security")
   fi

   if [[ $MODE == "performance-focus" ]] || grep -q "performance\|optimize\|cache\|database" <<< "$PR_DESCRIPTION"; then
       AGENTS_NEEDED+=("performance")
   fi

   



   # Always include basic analysis for complex PRs
   if [[ $QUALITY_ISSUES -gt 5 ]] || [[ $MODE == "thorough" ]]; then
       AGENTS_NEEDED+=("edge-case" "test-architect")
   fi


   



   echo "ü§ñ Coordinating ${#AGENTS_NEEDED[@]} specialized agents: ${AGENTS_NEEDED[*]}"
   ```

2. **Model Validation and Fallbacks**:



   ```bash
   # Validate model availability before agent coordination
   MODELS_AVAILABLE=()


   ```bash
   # Validate model availability before agent coordination
   MODELS_AVAILABLE=()
   

   ```bash
   # Validate model availability before agent coordination
   MODELS_AVAILABLE=()


   # Test each model with a simple call first
   for model in "anthropic/claude-opus-4" "o3" "deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:free"; do
       if zen_mcp_test_model "$model" 2>/dev/null; then
           MODELS_AVAILABLE+=("$model")
       else
           echo "‚ö†Ô∏è  Model $model unavailable, using fallback"
       fi
   done


   



   # Ensure we have at least one working model
   if [[ ${#MODELS_AVAILABLE[@]} -eq 0 ]]; then
       echo "üîÑ All preferred models unavailable, falling back to single-agent analysis"
       SKIP_MULTI_AGENT=true
   fi
   ```

3. **Streamlined Agent Coordination** (only if needed):
   - **Security Analysis** (conditional):





     ```text
     Use Zen MCP Server for Security Auditor (validated model):
     - Model: First available from [claude-opus-4, anthropic/claude-sonnet-4]
     - Focus: Critical security patterns in changed files only
     - Quick assessment: authentication, input validation, dependency risks
     ```

   - **Performance Analysis** (conditional):



     ```text
     Use Zen MCP Server for Performance Analyst (validated model):
     - Model: First available from [o3, o4-mini]

     ```text
     Use Zen MCP Server for Performance Analyst (validated model):
     - Model: First available from [o3, o4-mini]  


     ```text
     Use Zen MCP Server for Performance Analyst (validated model):
     - Model: First available from [o3, o4-mini]

     - Focus: Algorithm complexity and resource usage patterns
     - Quick assessment: obvious performance bottlenecks only
     ```

### Step 4: Smart Consensus Decision

1. **Adaptive Consensus Strategy**:





   ```bash
   # Choose consensus approach based on complexity and quality issues
   if [[ $SKIP_MULTI_AGENT == "true" ]]; then
       echo "üìã Clear rejection case - generating direct feedback report"
       CONSENSUS_MODE="direct"
   elif [[ $QUALITY_ISSUES -le 3 ]] && [[ ${#AGENTS_NEEDED[@]} -le 1 ]]; then
       echo "‚úÖ Straightforward case - lightweight consensus"
       CONSENSUS_MODE="lightweight"
   else
       echo "ü§î Complex case - full multi-agent consensus"
       CONSENSUS_MODE="comprehensive"
   fi
   ```

2. **Consensus Execution with Model Validation**:



   ```text
   Only run full consensus for complex cases:

   /zen:consensus (if CONSENSUS_MODE == "comprehensive")

   Models to consult (validated availability):
   - First available: [anthropic/claude-opus-4, anthropic/claude-sonnet-4]
   - First available: [o3, o4-mini]
   - First available: [deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:free, google/gemini-2.5-flash]




   ```text
   Only run full consensus for complex cases:

   /zen:consensus (if CONSENSUS_MODE == "comprehensive")

   Models to consult (validated availability):
   - First available: [anthropic/claude-opus-4, anthropic/claude-sonnet-4]
   - First available: [o3, o4-mini]
   - First available: [deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:free, google/gemini-2.5-flash]

   



   For lightweight cases, use single high-quality model assessment.
   For direct cases, skip consensus and generate immediate actionable feedback.
   ```

### Step 5: Testing Execution and Validation

1. **Execute Enhanced Test Suite**:
   - Run existing tests: `poetry run pytest -v --cov=src`
   - Execute security tests from Security Auditor recommendations
   - Run edge case scenarios from Edge Case Hunter analysis
   - Validate performance benchmarks if applicable

2. **Integration Testing**:
   - Test with external dependencies (Qdrant, Azure AI)
   - Validate multi-agent coordination if agents modified
   - Check UI/API integration points affected by changes

### Step 6: Generate Actionable PR Review Report

Generate mode-appropriate review report with GitHub integration:

```markdown
