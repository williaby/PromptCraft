# Workflow Scope Analysis

Analyze and define boundaries for a project issue to prevent scope creep: $ARGUMENTS

## Usage Options
- `phase X issue Y` - Standard analysis (e.g., "phase 1 issue 3")
- `quick phase X issue Y` - Essential boundary definition only
- `detailed phase X issue Y` - Comprehensive analysis with validation

## Instructions

### Step 1: Issue-Specific Analysis

1. **Read ONLY the Issue Definition First**:
   - `/docs/planning/phase-{X}-issues.md` - Find the SPECIFIC issue requirements
   - **STOP HERE** - Do not read broader documentation yet

2. **Extract and Isolate Issue Scope**:
   - Issue title and description
   - **Acceptance criteria** (this defines the boundary)
   - Dependencies listed in the issue
   - Testing requirements from the issue
   - Time estimates
   - **Document the EXACT scope boundary**

### Step 2: Scope Boundary Validation

1. **Define Issue Boundaries**:
   - List what IS included in acceptance criteria
   - List what is NOT mentioned in acceptance criteria
   - Identify any ambiguous requirements that need clarification

2. **Track Current Acceptance Criteria Status**:
   - Mark completed criteria as `[x]` in phase-{X}-issues.md
   - Update issue status (Open/In Process/Closed) based on completion
   - Document specific criteria that need attention

3. **Create Scope Constraint Document**:
   ```
   ISSUE SCOPE BOUNDARY:
   ‚úÖ INCLUDED: [List from acceptance criteria]
   ‚ùå EXCLUDED: [Anything not in acceptance criteria]
   ‚ùì UNCLEAR: [Items needing clarification]

   ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA STATUS:
   ‚úÖ COMPLETED: [List completed criteria]
   üîÑ IN PROGRESS: [List partially completed criteria]
   ‚ùå PENDING: [List remaining criteria]
   ```

### Step 3: Contextual Research (Only After Scope Definition)

**ONLY AFTER establishing scope boundaries**, read supporting documentation as needed:
- `/docs/planning/ADR.md` - Read ONLY architectural decisions relevant to your defined scope
- `/docs/planning/ts-{X}-overview.md` - Read ONLY sections relevant to your defined scope
- `/docs/planning/ts-{X}-implementation.md` - Read ONLY implementation details for items in scope
- `/docs/planning/project-hub.md` - Read ONLY if broader project context is needed for acceptance criteria
- `/docs/planning/four_journeys.md` - Read ONLY if journey context is explicitly mentioned in issue
- `/docs/planning/development.md` - Read ONLY for development standards relevant to acceptance criteria
- `README.md` - Read ONLY if basic project setup is part of acceptance criteria

**Research Constraint**: Only read sections that directly relate to items in your acceptance criteria. Skip all other content.

## Output Format

```markdown
# Scope Analysis: Phase {X} Issue {Y}

## Issue Overview
- **Title**: [Issue title]
- **Description**: [Brief description]
- **Estimated Time**: [From issue]

## Scope Boundaries
‚úÖ **INCLUDED in Issue**:
- [Item 1 from acceptance criteria]
- [Item 2 from acceptance criteria]

‚ùå **EXCLUDED from Issue**:
- [Item not mentioned in acceptance criteria]
- [Another excluded item]

‚ùì **UNCLEAR Requirements**:
- [Ambiguous item needing clarification]

## Acceptance Criteria Status
‚úÖ **COMPLETED** ([X/Y] criteria met):
- [List completed acceptance criteria]

üîÑ **IN PROGRESS** ([X/Y] criteria partially met):
- [List partially completed criteria with status]

‚ùå **PENDING** ([X/Y] criteria remaining):
- [List remaining criteria to implement]

## Dependencies
- [List from issue]

## Next Steps
- Update issue status in phase-{X}-issues.md based on completion
- Proceed to `/project:workflow-plan-validation` with these boundaries
- Address unclear requirements before planning
```

## Error Handling

- **Issue file not found**: Report missing file path and suggest creating placeholder
- **No acceptance criteria**: Request clarification from user before proceeding
- **Ambiguous scope**: Generate specific clarifying questions
- **Dependencies missing**: List what needs to be resolved first

## Examples

```bash
# Standard scope analysis
/project:workflow-scope-analysis phase 1 issue 3

# Quick boundary definition
/project:workflow-scope-analysis quick phase 2 issue 7

# Detailed analysis with full validation
/project:workflow-scope-analysis detailed phase 1 issue 1
```
