# Python 3.10 UTC Compatibility Issues - AUTH-4 Database Fix

## Problem
The codebase uses `from datetime import UTC, datetime` which is not available in Python 3.10.
UTC was introduced in Python 3.11.

## Solution Pattern
Replace all occurrences of:
```python
from datetime import UTC, datetime
```

With:
```python
# Python 3.10 compatibility for UTC
try:
    from datetime import UTC, datetime
except ImportError:
    from datetime import datetime, timezone
    UTC = timezone.utc
```

## Files Fixed
- [x] src/database/models.py
- [x] src/auth/models.py
- [x] tests/unit/database/test_models.py
- [x] tests/unit/test_config_management.py

## Files Still Needing Fix
- [ ] src/auth/services/alert_engine.py
- [ ] src/auth/services/security_logger.py
- [ ] src/auth/services/risk_analyzer.py
- [ ] src/auth/services/health_assessor.py
- [ ] src/auth/services/security_integration.py
- [ ] src/auth/services/metrics_calculator.py
- [ ] src/auth/services/suspicious_activity_detector.py
- [ ] src/auth/services/security_monitor.py
- [ ] src/auth/services/mock_data_service.py
- [ ] And 20+ other files in src/

## Status
Core database functionality is working. Need to systematically fix remaining files
or require Python 3.11+ in production.

## Next Steps
1. Focus on getting tests running first
2. Fix critical auth service files
3. Consider making Python 3.11+ a requirement
